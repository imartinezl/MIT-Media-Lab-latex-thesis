## thanks
It uses tiff's ([@scientiffic](https://twitter.com/scientiffic)) tufte-latex-mit LaTeX thesis format, available [here](https://github.com/ttseng/tufte-latex-mit).  It is based on [MIT's LaTeX thesis template](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/) integrated with [Tufte-LaTeX] (https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/).  Thanks @ttseng!
