# LearnAir Master's Thesis
David's working master's latex thesis.

**The final version is available [here](https://davidbramsay.com/public/RamsayMastersThesis.pdf).**

## thanks
It uses tiff's ([@scientiffic](https://twitter.com/scientiffic)) tufte-latex-mit LaTeX thesis format, available [here](https://github.com/ttseng/tufte-latex-mit).  It is based on [MIT's LaTeX thesis template](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/) integrated with [Tufte-LaTeX] (https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/).  Thanks @ttseng!

## more about LearnAir

**code written for LearnAir includes:**
+ [chainCrawler and chainSearcher](https://github.com/dramsay9/chaincrawler) - *a web crawler and a breadth-first-search tool for the semantic web data achitecture ChainAPI*
+ [chainTraverser and chainDataPush](https://github.com/dramsay9/chainlearnairdata) - *a stateful web spider to traverse, upload, modify, and interact with ChainAPI nodes and data, including pushing data from Excel files*
+ [chainProcessor](https://github.com/dramsay9/chaindataprocessor) - *a scalable machine learning crawler framework, which automatically crawls and downloads data from a list of 'known' device types in ChainAPI, processes their data using a device-specific model (that automatically updates when new data is found), and uploads that processed data back into ChainAPI*
+ [an Air Quality Ontology Adaptation of Chain API](https://github.com/dramsay9/chain-api) ([original tool](https://github.com/ResEnv/chain-api) written by Spencer Russel et al) - *air quality data ontology written with ChainAPI- a semantic web, RESTful Sensor API*
